Business\\nGeneral\\nApple Computer, Inc. (\"Apple\" or the \"Company\") was incorporated under  the\\nlaws  of  the  State  of  California on January  3,  1977.   The  Company\\'s\\nprincipal executive offices are located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino,\\nCalifornia, 95014 and its telephone number is (408) 996-1010.\\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets microprocessor-based personal\\ncomputers  and  related personal computing products for sale  primarily  to\\nbusiness, education, home, and government customers.  Substantially all  of\\nthe Company\\'s net sales to date have been derived from the sale of personal\\ncomputers  from its Apple Macintosh line of computers and related  software\\nand  peripherals.   The Company operates in one principal industry  segment\\nacross geographically diverse marketplaces.\\nApple  delivers a full range of information solutions  to people in a wide \\nvariety of growing markets.  The Company\\'s strategy is  to maintain  and  \\nexpand  its market share in the personal  computer  industry while  \\ndeveloping  and  expanding  new  related  businesses,  such  as  its\\nbusinesses  in  on-line  services, licensing of the Macintosh operating  \\nsystem, client/server  systems  and  personal  interactive  electronics.\\nHistorically, the Company\\'s principal products were built using the Motorola\\n68000  series  of  Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) microprocessors.\\nHowever,  computer  manufacturers  are  beginning  to  move  from   a   CISC\\narchitecture  to  a  Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)  architecture.\\nAccordingly,  during 1994, the Company began a major product transition  and\\nintroduced  a  new  line  of  Macintosh  computers  based  on  the PowerPC \\n(registered trademark) architecture,  a  new  RISC  microprocessor  jointly\\ndeveloped  by   Apple, International  Business Machines Corporation (IBM) \\nand Motorola,  Inc.   The Company  believes  that these PowerPC based \\nproducts will yield  significant improvements in price/performance and \\nfunctionality compared with  its  CISC-based  products.  Further information\\nregarding this product transition  may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Form 10-K\")  under  the subheading \"Product\\nIntroductions and Transitions\"  included under  the  heading  \"Factors That \\nMay Affect Future Results  and  Financial Condition\", which information is \\nhereby incorporated by reference.\\n \\nPrincipal products\\nThe Company offers a wide range of personal computing products, including\\npersonal  computers, related peripherals, software,  and  networking  and\\nconnectivity products.\\nPersonal Computing Products\\nApple  Macintosh (registered trademark) personal computers were first \\nintroduced in 1984,  and are characterized by their intuitive ease of use, \\ninnovative applications base, and built-in networking, graphics and \\nmultimedia capabilities.\\nCurrently, the Company uses two types of microprocessors in its  line  of\\npersonal  computing  products.  Products  based  on  the  new  RISC-based\\nmicroprocessors  includes the Power Macintosh(TM) family and  the  Macintosh\\nPerforma (registered trademark)  6100  series  of  personal computers.  \\nProducts  based  on  the Motorola  series of microprocessors include the \\nMacintosh  LC,  Macintosh Performa,  Macintosh Quadra (registered trademark), \\nand the PowerBook (registered trademark) families of  computers.\\nGenerally,  products based on the Motorola series of microprocessors  can\\nalso be upgraded to take advantage of the PowerPC processor.\\nPower Macintosh\\nThe  Power  Macintosh family of personal computers  is  the  first  Apple\\ncomputer to use PowerPC, a new RISC-based microprocessor developed by Apple, \\nIBM, and Motorola, Inc.  This new high-performance  family  of personal \\ncomputers is targeted  at  business  and professional  users  and  is \\ndesigned to meet the  speed,  expansion\\n                                    2\\n<PAGE>\\nand networking  needs  of  the most demanding Macintosh  user.   These  \\nPower Macintosh  products  not  only support virtually all  existing  \\nMacintosh applications, but can also run MS-DOS and Windows applications \\nwhen using SoftWindows software from Insignia Solutions.\\nMacintosh LC\\nThe   LC  family  of  personal  computers  offers  high  performance  and\\ncompetitive prices in a flexible, modular design.  LC personal  computers\\nare  well-suited for education and business applications  such  as graphics,\\ncolor presentations and spreadsheets.  LC products are also capable of  \\nrunning the  Apple  IIe applications that a large number of primary and \\nsecondary schools have acquired over the years.\\nMacintosh Performa\\nThe Performa family of personal computers is designed to appeal to first-\\ntime  personal  computer  users.  These products feature  all-in-one  box\\ncomputing  solutions, including software and hardware chosen specifically\\nwith  home users in mind.

The Company is also continuing its  expansion  into\\nnew  distribution  channels,  such as mass merchandise  stores,  consumer\\nelectronics  outlets  and computer superstores, in response  to  changing\\nindustry practices and customer preferences.  The Company\\'s products  are\\nsold  primarily to business and government customers through  independent\\nresellers,  value-added  resellers  and  systems  integrators;  to   home\\ncustomers  through independent resellers and consumer  channels;  and  to\\neducation  customers through direct sales and independent resellers.   In\\norder to provide products and service to its independent resellers  on  a\\ntimely  basis, the Company distributes its products through a  number  of\\nApple distribution and support centers.\\nBusiness  customers  account for the largest  portion  of  the  Company\\'s\\nrevenues.    Business  customers  are  attracted  to  the  Macintosh   in\\nparticular for a variety of reasons, including the availability of a wide\\nvariety of application software, the reduced amount of training resulting\\nfrom  the  Macintosh\\'s  intuitive ease of use, and  the  ability  of  the\\nMacintosh  to  network  and communicate with other computer  systems  and\\nenvironments.\\nApple personal computers were first introduced to education customers  in\\nthe  late 1970\\'s.  In the United States, the Company is one of the  major\\nsuppliers of personal computers for both elementary and secondary  school\\ncustomers, as well as for college and university customers.  The  Company\\nis  also  a  substantial  supplier to institutions  of  higher  education\\noutside of the United States.\\n                                       \\nIn  the  United  States,  the Company\\'s formal commitment  to  serve  the\\nfederal  government began in 1986 with the formation of the Apple Federal\\nSystems Group.  Although the Company has contracts with a number of  U.S.\\ngovernment  agencies, these contracts are not currently material  to  the\\nCompany\\'s overall financial condition or results of operations.\\nPresently,  the United States represents the Company\\'s largest geographic\\nmarketplace.  The Apple USA organization, based in Campbell,  California,\\nfocuses  on  the Company\\'s sales, marketing, and support efforts  in  the\\nUnited  States.   Products  sold  in  the  United  States  are  primarily\\nmanufactured  in  the Company\\'s facilities in California,  Colorado,  and\\nSingapore, and distributed from facilities in California and Illinois.\\nApproximately  45% to 46% of the Company\\'s revenues in recent  years  has\\ncome   from   its   international  operations.   The  Company   has   two\\ninternational sales and marketing divisions, consisting of the Apple Europe\\n                                    4\\n<PAGE>\\ndivision  and  the  Apple Pacific  division.   The  Apple  Europe\\ndivision,  based in Paris, France, focuses on opportunities in Europe  as\\nwell as in parts of Africa and in the Middle East.  Products sold by  the\\nEurope  division are manufactured primarily in the Company\\'s facility  in\\nCork,   Ireland.   The  Apple  Pacific  division,  based  in   Cupertino,\\nCalifornia, focuses on opportunities in Japan, Australia, Canada, the Far\\nEast,  and  Latin  America.  Products sold by the  Pacific  division  are\\nmanufactured  primarily  in  the  Company\\'s  manufacturing  and  assembly\\nfacilities in California, Colorado and Singapore.\\nA  summary  of the Company\\'s Industry Segment and Geographic  Information\\nmay  be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under  the  heading  \\n\"Industry  Segment  and   Geographic Information\", which information is \\nhereby incorporated by reference.\\nRaw materials\\nAlthough  raw  materials,  processes, and  components  essential  to  the\\nCompany\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\nkey  components are currently obtained from single sources.  For example,\\ncertain  microprocessors  used  in many of  the  Company\\'s  products  are\\ncurrently   available   only  from  Motorola,  Inc.    Any   availability\\nlimitations,  interruption in supplies, or price  increases  relative  to\\nthese and other components  could adversely affect the Company\\'s business\\nand  financial results.  Key components and processes currently  obtained\\nfrom   single   sources  include  certain  of  the  Company\\'s   displays,\\nmicroprocessors,  mouse devices, keyboards, disk drives,  CD-ROM  drives,\\nprinters  and  printer  components, ASICs and  other  custom  chips,  and\\ncertain processes relating to construction of the plastic housing for the\\nCompany\\'s computers.  In addition, new products introduced by the Company\\noften  initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source,\\nuntil the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for an additional\\nsupplier.   In  situations  where a component  or  product  utilizes  new\\ntechnologies  and  processes, there may be initial capacity   constraints\\nuntil  such  time as the suppliers\\' yields have matured.   Materials  and\\ncomponents are normally acquired through purchase orders, as is common in\\nthe  industry, typically covering the Company\\'s requirements for  periods\\nfrom 90 to 180 days.  However, the Company continues to evaluate the need\\nfor a supply contract in each situation.\\nIf  the supply of a key single-sourced material, process, or component to\\nthe  Company  were to be delayed or curtailed, its ability  to  ship  the\\nrelated product utilizing such material, process, or component in desired\\nquantities  and  in  a  timely manner could be adversely  affected.   The\\nCompany\\'s  business  and financial performance could  also  be  adversely\\naffected,  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities\\nfrom the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\\nfrom  an alternate source.  The Company believes that the suppliers whose\\nloss  to  the  Company  could have a material  adverse  effect  upon  the\\nCompany\\'s  business and financial position include, at this time,  Canon,\\nInc.,  General  Electric Co., Hitachi, Ltd., IBM, Motorola,  Inc.,  Sharp\\nCorporation,  Sony Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc.,  Tokyo  Electric\\nCo.,  Ltd.,  and/or their United States affiliates, and VLSI  Technology,\\nInc.   However,  the  Company helps mitigate  these  potential  risks  by\\nworking   closely  with  these  and  other  key  suppliers   on   product\\nintroduction  plans,  strategic  inventories,  and  coordinated   product\\nintroductions.   The  Company believes that  most  of  its  single-source\\nsuppliers,  including  most  of  the foregoing  companies,  are  reliable\\nmultinational  corporations.   Most of these  suppliers  manufacture  the\\nrelevant  materials,  processes, or components in multiple  plants.   The\\nCompany  further  believes that its long-standing business  relationships\\nwith these and other key suppliers are strong and mutually beneficial in \\nnature.\\nThe  Company  has  a  supply agreement with Motorola, Inc.  (see  Exhibit\\n10.B.12  hereto).  The agreement with Motorola continues for  five  years\\nfrom January 31, 1992 unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by  the\\nparties.   The Company single-sources microprocessors from Motorola.  The\\nsupply  agreement does not obligate the Company to make minimum  purchase\\ncommitments; however, the agreement does commit the vendor to supply  the\\nCompany\\'s  requirements of the particular items for the duration  of  the\\nagreement.\\nThe  Company  has  also from time to time experienced  significant  price\\nincreases  and  limited  availability  of  certain  components  that  are\\navailable  from  multiple sources, such as dynamic  random-access  memory\\ndevices.   Any  similar occurrences in the future could have  an  adverse\\neffect on the Company\\'s operating results.\\n                                        5\\n<PAGE>\\nPatents, trademarks, copyrights and licenses\\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating  to\\ncertain aspects of its computer and peripheral systems.  In addition, the\\nCompany has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the\\nUnited  States and a number of foreign countries for \"Apple\",  the  Apple\\nsilhouette  logo, the Apple color logo, \"Macintosh\", Newton,  the  Newton\\nLightbulb  logo,  and  numerous other product trademarks.  In  1986,  the\\nCompany  acquired  ownership  of the trademark  \"Macintosh\"  for  use  in\\nconnection  with computer products.  Although the Company  believes  that\\nthe ownership of such patents, copyrights, and trademarks is an important\\nfactor  in its business and that its success does depend in part  on  the\\nownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills,\\ntechnical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nBecause  of  technological  changes in  the  computer  industry,  current\\nextensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents,\\nit  is  possible  that certain components of the Company\\'s  products  may\\nunknowingly  infringe existing patents of others.  The Company believes the\\nresolution  of  any  claim of infringements would  not  have  a  material\\nadverse  effect on its financial condition and results of  operations  as\\nreported in the accompanying financial statements.  However, depending on\\nthe amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of any such claims  of\\ninfringement,  it  is  possible  that the  Company\\'s  future  results  of\\noperations  or  cash flow could be materially affected  in  a  particular\\nperiod.   The  Company has from time to time entered into cross-licensing\\nagreements with other companies.\\nThe Company is engaged in certain litigation relating to its intellectual\\nproperty.   A description of such litigation is set forth  in\\nthe  footnote to the financial statements under the subheading \"Litigation\"\\nincluded under the heading entitled \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in  Part\\nII,  Item  8   of   this   Form   10-K (Microsoft/Hewlett-Packard,  Lemelson\\nand Grant litigation), which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  \\nSeasonal business\\nAlthough  the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal,\\nit  has  historically experienced increased sales in its first  and  fourth\\nfiscal  quarters,  compared to other quarters in its fiscal  year,  due  to\\nholiday demand for and calendar year-end buying of some of its products.\\nWarranty\\nThe Company offers a parts and labor limited warranty on its products.  The\\nwarranty period is one year from the date of purchase by the end user.  The\\nCompany  also  offers  a 90-day warranty for Apple service  parts  used  to\\nrepair  Apple  hardware  products.   In addition,  consumers  may  purchase\\nextended service coverage on all Apple hardware products.\\nCustomers\\nNo  customer  of  the Company accounted for 10% or more of  net  sales  for\\nfiscal year 1994.\\nBacklog\\nIn  general, the Company\\'s resellers typically purchase products on an  as-\\nneeded  basis due to the Company\\'s distribution strategy, which is designed\\nto  expedite  the filling of orders.  Resellers frequently change  delivery\\nschedules   and  order  rates  depending  on  changing  market  conditions.\\nUnfilled  orders (backlog) can be, and often are, canceled  at  will.   The\\nCompany  attempts  to  fill  orders on the  requested  delivery  schedules.\\nHowever, products may be in relatively short supply from time to time until\\nproduction  volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet  demand  or  if\\nother  constraints  exist.  The Company\\'s backlog of  unfilled  orders \\nremained relatively unchanged at approximately $663 million at both \\nDecember  2, 1994,  and  November  19,  1993.   The  Company  expects  that \\nsubstantially all of its orders in backlog at December  2,  1994  will  be \\neither shipped or canceled during fiscal 1995.\\n                                        6\\n<PAGE>\\n \\nIn  the  Company\\'s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any\\nparticular  time  is  not a meaningful indication of  its  future  business\\nprospects.   In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation  of  or\\nimmediately following introduction of new products because of over-ordering\\nby  dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced sharply  once\\ndealers  and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.   Because\\nof the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company\\'s backlog,\\nbacklog  should  not be considered a reliable indicator  of  the  Company\\'s\\nfuture  revenue or financial performance.  Further information regarding\\nthe  Company\\'s backlog may be found under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K\\nunder the heading \"Factors  that  May Affect  Future  Results  and Financial\\nCondition,\"  which  information  is hereby incorporated by reference.\\nCompetition\\nThe  market  for the design, manufacture and sale of personal  computers,\\npersonal digital assistants, and related software and peripheral products\\nis  highly  competitive.   It  continues to  be  characterized  by  rapid\\ntechnological  advances  in both hardware and software  development  that\\nhave  substantially increased the capabilities and applications of  these\\nproducts,  and has resulted in the frequent introduction of new products.\\nThe  principal competitive factors in this market are product quality and\\nreliability,   availability  of  software,  product  features,   relative\\nprice/performance,  marketing and distribution  capability,  service  and\\nsupport, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation.\\nFurther discussion relating to the competitive conditions of the personal\\ncomputing  industry and the Company\\'s competitive position in the  market\\nplace may be found under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the \\nsubheading \"Competition,\" included under the heading \"Factors that may \\nAffect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" which information is hereby \\nincorporated by reference.\\nResearch and development\\nBecause   the  personal  computer  industry  is  characterized   by   rapid\\ntechnological  advances, the Company\\'s ability to compete  successfully  is\\nheavily  dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely  flow\\nof  competitive  products  to the marketplace.  The  Company  continues  to\\ndevelop  new products and technologies and to enhance existing products  in\\nthe  areas of hardware and peripherals, system software, and networking and\\ncommunications. The Company\\'s research and development expenditures totaled\\n$564  million, $665 million, and $602 million, in fiscal years  1994,  1993\\nand 1992, respectively.\\nFurther  information  regarding the Company\\'s R&D expenditures  for  fiscal\\nyear  1995  is  set  forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form  10-K  under  the\\nheading  \"Operating Expenses,\" and which information is hereby incorporated\\nby reference.\\nEnvironmental laws\\nCompliance  with United States federal, state, and local laws  enacted  for\\nthe  protection of the environment has to date had no material effect  upon\\nthe  Company\\'s  capital  expenditures, earnings, or  competitive  position.\\nAlthough  the Company does not anticipate any material adverse  effects  in\\nthe  future  based on the nature of its operations and the thrust  of  such\\nlaws,  no assurance can be given that such laws, or any future laws enacted\\nfor  the  protection of the environment, will not have a  material  adverse\\neffect on the Company.\\nEmployees\\nAt  September 30, 1994, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide  had  11,287\\nregular  employees,  and  an  additional  3,305  temporary  or  part-time\\ncontractors and employees.\\nForeign and domestic operations and geographic data\\nInformation  regarding financial data by geographic area  and  the  risks\\nassociated with international operations is set forth under Part II, Item\\n8  of  this  Form 10-K under the heading \"Industry Segment and Geographic\\nInformation\",  and under Part II, Item 7 of this Form  10-K \\nunder  the subheading \"Global Market Risks,\" \\n                                        7\\n<PAGE>\\nincluded under the heading \"Factors that may Affect Future Results and \\nFinancial Condition,\" which information is  hereby incorporated by reference.\\nMargins  on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on domestic\\nsales   of  products  that  include  components  obtained  from   foreign\\nsuppliers,  can be adversely affected by foreign currency  exchange  rate\\nfluctuations  and  by international trade regulations, including  tariffs\\nand anti-dumping penalties.\\nItem 2.

The\\nCompany  has  manufacturing facilities in Fountain,  Colorado,  Sacramento,\\nCalifornia,  Cork, Ireland, and Singapore.  As of September 30,  1994,  the\\nCompany leased approximately 5.2 million square feet of space, primarily in\\nthe  United  States,  and to a lesser extent, in Europe  and  the  Pacific.\\nLeases  are  generally for terms of five to ten years, and usually  provide\\nrenewal options for terms of up to five additional years.  Certain of these\\nleased  facilities  are  subject  to the  Company\\'s  restructuring  actions\\ninitiated in the third quarter of both 1993 and 1991.  The amount of space\\nleased  by  the  Company  may  decline in the  future  as  the  leases  for\\nfacilities  subject  to  restructuring actions are terminated  pursuant  to\\nagreements with landlords or expire as scheduled.\\nThe  Company owns its manufacturing facilities in Fountain, Colorado, Cork,\\nIreland, and Singapore, which total approximately 920,000 square feet.

The net sales growth  in\\n1994 over 1993 was primarily due to two factors: unit sales growth and,  to\\na lesser extent, an increase in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh\\ncomputer unit.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales increased 16% over  the\\nprior  year.   This growth resulted principally from strong  sales  of  the\\nCompany\\'s  new  Power Macintosh products, first introduced  on  March  14,\\n1994,  and  from  sales  of newer product offerings  within  the  Macintosh\\nPerforma  line  of  desktop personal computers and, to  a  lesser  extent,\\nwithin  the PowerBook family of notebook personal computers.  This  growth\\nwas  partially  offset by declining unit sales in certain of the  Company\\'s\\nmore   established  products  and  older  product  versions.   The  average\\naggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased slightly, primarily  due  to\\nfluctuations  in  product mix throughout the year, despite pricing  actions\\nundertaken  by  the Company in response to continuing industrywide  pricing\\npressures.\\nTotal  Macintosh  computer unit sales increased  32%  from  1992  to  1993,\\nreflecting  strong  unit  sales of the Company\\'s  newer  product  offerings\\nwithin  the  Macintosh Quadra, LC and Performa lines of  desktop  personal\\ncomputers  and within the PowerBook family of notebook personal  computers.\\nThis growth was partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of  the\\nCompany\\'s  more  established  products and  older  product  versions.   The\\naverage aggregate revenue per unit declined 15% in 1993 compared with 1992,\\nprimarily  as  a  result of pricing actions undertaken by  the  Company  in\\nresponse to continuing industrywide pricing pressures.\\nIn  1994,  domestic net sales increased 14% over the prior  year,  compared\\nwith  an  increase of 13% in 1993 over 1992.  International net sales  grew\\n17%  from  1993  to  1994,  compared with 12% growth  from  1992  to  1993,\\nprimarily  as  a  result  of strong sales growth  in  the  Pacific  region,\\nparticularly  in  Japan.  International net sales represented  46%  of  net\\nsales in 1994 compared with 45% of net sales in both 1993 and 1992.\\nGross Margin\\nGross margin in 1994 continued to decline as a percentage of net sales from\\n1993  and  1992 levels.  The gross margin percentage declined to  25.5%  in\\n1994  from  34.2%  in  1993.   The downward trend  in  gross  margin  as  a\\npercentage  of net sales was primarily a result of pricing and  promotional\\nactions  undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide  competitive\\npricing pressures.\\n                                      12\\n<PAGE>\\nGross  margin  was also affected somewhat adversely by changes  in  foreign\\ncurrency  exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative  to\\ncertain  foreign currencies in 1994 compared with 1993.  Results  from  the\\nCompany\\'s  ongoing foreign currency hedging activities offset a portion  of\\nthis  adverse  foreign  currency  impact on  gross  margin.   Although  the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations can be significantly affected in the  short\\nterm  by  fluctuations  in foreign currency exchange rates,  the  Company\\'s\\noperating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange  rates\\nover time.\\nThe decline in gross margin as a percentage of net sales from 43.7% in 1992\\nto  34.2%  in  1993  was  primarily the result of industrywide  competitive\\npressures  and  associated  pricing  and  promotional  actions.   Inventory\\nvaluation  reserves recorded against certain products also  contributed  to\\nthe  decline  in gross margin as a percentage of net sales.  The  Company\\'s\\nresults  of  operations  were  minimally affected  by  changes  in  foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates in 1993 compared with 1992.\\nAlthough  the  Company\\'s gross margin percentage was 27.2% for  the  fourth\\nquarter  of  1994,   resulting primarily from  strong  sales  of    Power\\nMacintosh  computers  and  the PowerBook 500 series  of  notebook  personal\\ncomputers, it is anticipated that gross margins will remain under  pressure\\nand  could  fall below prior years\\' levels worldwide due to  a  variety  of\\nfactors,  including  continued  industrywide pricing  pressures,  increased\\ncompetition, and compressed product life cycles.\\n<TABLE>                                                            \\n<CAPTION>\\nOperating Expenses                     1994  Change   1993  Change    1992\\n<S>                                     <C>    <C>     <C>     <C>    <C>\\nResearch and development             $  564    -15%  $  665    10%  $  602\\nPercentage of net sales                6.1%            8.3%           8.5%\\n</TABLE>                                                           \\nResearch  and  development expenditures decreased  in  amount  during  1994\\ncompared  with 1993 and 1992.  This decrease reflected the results  of  the\\nCompany\\'s restructuring actions aimed at reducing costs, including  product\\ndevelopment   expenditures.   The  increase  in  research  and  development\\nexpenditures  from 1992 to 1993 reflected net additions  to  the  Company\\'s\\nengineering   staff   and   related  costs.    Research   and   development\\nexpenditures,  as  a percentage of net sales, decreased  since  1992  as  a\\nresult  of  revenue growth during 1993 and 1994, coupled with the Company\\'s\\ncontinuing efforts to focus its research and development project spending.\\nThe  Company believes that continued investment in research and development\\nis   critical  to  its  future  growth  and  competitive  position  in  the\\nmarketplace,  and is directly related to continued, timely  development  of\\nnew  and  enhanced  products.   Although the Company  continues  to  manage\\noperating  expense growth relative to gross margin levels,  it  anticipates\\nthat  research and development expenditures in 1995 will increase  slightly\\nin amount.\\n<TABLE>                                                            \\n<CAPTION>\\n                                       1994  Change   1993  Change    1992\\n<S>                                  <C>       <C>    <C>     <C>    <C>\\nSelling, general and administrative  $1,384    -15%  $1,632   -3%    $1,687\\nPercentage of net sales               15.1%           20.5%           23.8%\\n</TABLE>                                                           \\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and  as  a\\npercentage  of  net  sales in 1994 and 1993 compared with  1993  and  1992,\\nrespectively.

Other factors contributing to this variance include interest\\nincome,  which  was  higher in 1993 than in 1994 primarily  due  to  a  $15\\nmillion interest payment received on a non-recurring income tax refund from\\nthe  Internal  Revenue  Service  in 1993,  and  interest  income  from  the\\nCompany\\'s  interest  rate  risk management program,  which  contributed  $6\\nmillion in 1993, and reduced interest income by $7 million in 1994.\\nInterest  and  other income (expense), net, decreased  in  amount  in  1993\\ncompared  with  1992 because of lower interest rates, lower cash  balances,\\nexpenses associated with certain financing transactions, lower gains on the\\nsale  of  certain of the Company\\'s venture capital investments, an increase\\nin  the cost of hedging certain foreign currency exposures, and an increase\\nin  interest expense due to higher commercial paper borrowing levels.

Inherent in this process  are  a  number  of\\nfactors  that  the Company must successfully manage in order  to  achieve\\nfavorable future operating results and financial condition.\\nProduct Introductions and Transitions\\nDue  to  the  highly  volatile nature of the personal computer  industry,\\nwhich  is  characterized by dynamic customer demand  patterns  and  rapid\\ntechnological  advances, the Company frequently introduces  new  products\\nand  product  enhancements.  The success of new product introductions  is\\ndependent  on  a  number  of factors, including  market  acceptance,  the\\nCompany\\'s   ability   to  manage  the  risks  associated   with   product\\ntransitions,  the effective management of inventory levels in  line  with\\nanticipated  product  demand,  and  the  manufacturing  of  products   in\\nappropriate  quantities  to meet anticipated  demand.   Accordingly,  the\\nCompany cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will  have\\non its sales or results of operations.\\nOn  March 14, 1994, the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of\\nMacintosh   computers   based   on  a  new   PowerPC   family   of   RISC\\nmicroprocessors.   The  Company\\'s results  of  operations  and  financial\\ncondition  may  be  adversely affected if it is  unable  to  successfully\\ncomplete  the transition of its lines of personal computers  and  servers\\nfrom  the  Motorola  68000  series  of  microprocessors  to  the  PowerPC\\nmicroprocessor.  The success of this ongoing transition  will  depend  on\\nthe  Company\\'s ability to continue to sell products based on the Motorola\\n68000  series of microprocessors while gaining market acceptance  of  the\\nnew  PowerPC  processor-based products, to successfully manage  inventory\\nlevels  of  both  product  lines  simultaneously,  and  to  continue   to\\ncoordinate   the  timely  development  and  distribution  by  independent\\nsoftware  vendors  of  new  \"native\" software  applications  specifically\\ndesigned for the PowerPC processor-based products.\\nThe rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new\\nproduct  is not necessarily an indication of the anticipated future  rate\\nof  shipments  for that product, which depends on many factors,  some  of\\nwhich  are  not  under  the control of the Company.   These  factors  may\\ninclude initial large purchases by a small segment of the user population\\nthat  tends  to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance  by  the\\nmajority of users (\"early adopters\"); purchases in satisfaction of  pent-\\nup  demand  by  users  who anticipated new technology  and  as  a  result\\ndeferred  purchases of other products; and overordering  by  dealers  who\\nanticipate  shortages due to the aforementioned factors.   The  preceding\\nmay also be offset by other factors, such as the deferral of purchases by\\nmany  users  until new technology is accepted as \"proven\" and  for  which\\ncommonly  used  software products are available;  and  the  reduction  of\\norders by dealers once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply  of\\nproduct previously in backlog.\\nBacklog  is  often volatile after new product introductions  due  to  the\\naforementioned  demand factors, often increasing sharply coincident  with\\nintroduction,  and  then  reducing sharply  once  dealers  and  customers\\nbelieve they can obtain sufficient supply of product.\\nThe  measurement  of  demand  for newly introduced  products  is  further\\ncomplicated  by  the  availability of different  product  configurations,\\nwhich  may  include various types of built-in peripherals  and  software.\\nConfigurations may also require certain localization (such  as  language)\\nfor  various  markets  and, as a result, demand in  different  geographic\\nareas  may  be a function of the availability of third-party software  in\\nthose  localized  versions.  For example, the availability  of  European-\\nlanguage versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may\\nlag  behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more.  This\\nmay result in lower initial demand for the Company\\'s new products outside\\nthe  United  States, although localized versions of the products  may  be\\navailable.\\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                                        \\n                                       15\\n<PAGE>\\nCompetition\\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues to  be\\ncharacterized by consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,\\naggressive  pricing practices, and downward pressure  on  gross  margins.\\nThe  Company\\'s  results of operations and financial  condition  could  be\\nadversely affected should the Company be unable to effectively manage the\\nimpact  of  industrywide pricing pressures and continue  to  realize  the\\nanticipated  cost -reduction benefits associated with  the  restructuring\\nplan initiated in the third quarter of 1993.\\nThe  Company\\'s future operating results and financial condition may  also\\nbe  affected  by  the  Company\\'s ability to offer  customers  competitive\\ntechnologies  while effectively managing the impact on  inventory  levels\\nand   the   potential   for  customer  confusion   created   by   product\\nproliferation.\\nOn  November 7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with International\\nBusiness  Machines Corporation (IBM) and Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware\\nreference  platform for the PowerPC microprocessor that is  intended  to\\ndeliver  a  much wider range of operating system and application  choices\\nfor  computer  customers.   As a result of this  agreement,  the  Company\\nintends  to  port the Macintosh operating system to the common  platform.\\nAccordingly,   the  Company\\'s  future  operating  results  and  financial\\ncondition  may be affected by its ability to implement this  and  certain\\nother collaboration agreements entered into, and to manage the associated\\ncompetitive risk.\\nThe  Company\\'s future operating results and financial condition may  also\\nbe  affected  by the Company\\'s ability to increase market  share  in  its\\npersonal computer business.  Currently, the Company is the only maker  of\\nhardware  that  uses  the  Macintosh operating system,  and  it  has  a\\nminority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated\\nby  makers  of  computers  that run the MS-DOS (registered trademark)  and  \\nMicrosoft  Windows(TM) operating  systems.  Certain of the Company\\'s \\npersonal computer  products are  capable  of  running software designed for\\nthe  MS-DOS  or  Windows operating  system,  through software emulation  of\\nIntel  microprocessor chips  (except  for one product, which does so by \\nmeans of a  coprocessor card).  Optimal performance of the Company\\'s products\\nis obtained by  use of  software  specifically  designed for the Company\\'s  \\nproducts,  either those  based  on  the Motorola 68000 series of \\nmicroprocessors  or  those based  on  the  PowerPC microprocessor.  However,\\nas  a  result  of  the collaboration  agreement noted in the preceding  \\nparagraph,  the  Company will  have  the opportunity to increase its market \\nshare in the  personal computer business as the Macintosh operating system \\nbecomes available  on computers based on the new hardware reference platform.\\nDecisions  by customers to purchase the Company\\'s personal computers,  as\\nopposed  to  MS-DOS  or Windows-based systems, are  often  based  on  the\\navailability  of  third-party software for particular applications.   The\\nCompany   believes  that  the  availability  of  third-party  application\\nsoftware for the Company\\'s hardware products depends in part on the third-\\nparty  developers\\'  perception and analysis of the relative  benefits  of\\ndeveloping  such software for the Company\\'s products versus software  for\\nthe  larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors\\nsuch  as  the  relative  market  share of  the  Company\\'s  products,  the\\nanticipated  potential  revenue that may be  earned,  and  the  costs  of\\ndeveloping such software products.\\nIn  an  effort  to  increase overall market share, the Company  plans  to\\nlicense the Macintosh operating system to other personal computer vendors\\nbeginning in 1995.  The Company anticipates that the licensing activities\\nwill  result  in  a variety of these vendors bringing to market  personal\\ncomputers  that  will run application software based  on  the  Macintosh\\noperating  system.  The Company also believes that licensing  will  offer\\nsoftware  vendors a broader installed base on which they can develop  and\\nprovide technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  At this  time,\\nthe  Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that  licensing of  the\\nMacintosh  operating  system  will  have  on  its  sales  or  results  of\\noperations.\\nMicrosoft  Corporation  is  the  developer  of  the  MS-DOS  and  Windows\\noperating systems, which are the principal competing operating systems to\\nthe Company\\'s Macintosh operating system.  Microsoft is also an important\\ndeveloper   of   application  software  for   the   Company\\'s   products.\\nAccordingly,  Microsoft\\'s interest in producing application software  for\\nthe Company\\'s products may be influenced by Microsoft\\'s perception of its\\ninterests as an operating system vendor.\\n                                       16\\n<PAGE>\\nThe  Company\\'s ability to produce and market competitive products is also\\ndependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of  the\\nnew PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company\\'s products, to\\ncontinue  to supply to the Company microprocessors which produce superior\\nprice/performance results compared with those supplied to  the  Company\\'s\\ncompetitors  by  Intel Corporation, the developer  and  producer  of  the\\nmicroprocessors  used  by most personal computers using  the  MS-DOS  and\\nWindows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based on  the\\nIntel  microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor,  and  is\\nalso the developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company\\'s\\nMacintosh operating system.  Accordingly, IBM\\'s interest in supplying the\\nCompany  with  improved  versions of microprocessors  for  the  Company\\'s\\nproducts  may  be influenced by IBM\\'s perception of its  interests  as  a\\ncompeting manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating\\nsystem vendor.\\nThe  Company\\'s future operating results and financial condition may  also\\nbe  affected  by  the Company\\'s  ability to successfully expand  its  new\\nbusinesses and product offerings into other markets, such as the  markets\\nfor on-line services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.\\nGlobal Market Risks\\nA  large  portion  of  the  Company\\'s revenue  is  derived  from  its\\ninternational operations.  As a result, the Company\\'s operations  and\\nfinancial  results could be significantly affected  by  international\\nfactors, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or  weak\\neconomic  conditions  in the foreign markets  in  which  the  Company\\ndistributes  its products.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens  against\\nother  currencies,  the  U.S. dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based\\nsales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value\\nof  non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the  U.S.\\ndollar  value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the  U.S.\\ndollar  weakens  and  decreases  when the  U.S.  dollar  strengthens.\\nOverall,  the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than  the\\nU.S.  dollar  and,  as  such, benefits from a weaker  dollar  and  is\\nadversely  affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies\\nworldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange  rates  may  negatively\\naffect  the  Company\\'s  consolidated  sales  and  gross  margins  (as\\nexpressed in U.S. dollars).\\nTo  mitigate  the short-term impact of fluctuating currency  exchange\\nrates   on   the  Company\\'s  non-U.S.  dollar-based  sales,   product\\nprocurement, and operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its\\nnon-U.S.  dollar-based exposures.  Specifically, the  Company  enters\\ninto  foreign  exchange forward and option contracts to hedge  firmly\\ncommitted   transactions.   Currently,  hedges  of  firmly  committed\\ntransactions  do  not  extend  beyond one  year.   The  Company  also\\npurchases  foreign exchange option contracts to hedge  certain  other\\nprobable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable,\\nbut  not firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.\\nTo  reduce  the costs associated with these ongoing foreign  exchange\\nhedging  programs, the Company also regularly sells foreign  exchange\\noption  contracts  and  enters into certain  other  foreign  exchange\\ntransactions.  All foreign exchange forward and option contracts  not\\naccounted  for  as  hedges,  including all transactions  intended  to\\nreduce  the  costs  associated with the  Company\\'s  foreign  exchange\\nhedging  programs,  are carried at fair value and are  adjusted  each\\nbalance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.\\nWhile  the Company is exposed with respect to the interest  rates  of\\nmany  of  the world\\'s leading industrialized countries, the Company\\'s\\ninterest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in  the\\ngeneral  level  of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard,  changes  in\\nU.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\\'s cash,\\ncash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid\\non  its  short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the\\nimpact  of  fluctuations  in U.S. interest  rates,  the  Company  has\\nentered into interest rate swap and option transactions.  Certain  of\\nthese  swaps are intended to better match the Company\\'s floating-rate\\ninterest  income  on  its  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term\\ninvestments  with  the fixed-rate interest expense on  its  long-term\\ndebt.  The Company also enters into interest rate swap, swaption, and\\noption  transactions in order to extend the effective duration  of  a\\nportion  of  its  cash,  cash equivalent, and  short-term  investment\\nportfolios.  These  swaps  may extend the Company\\'s  cash  investment\\nhorizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.\\n                                     17\\n<PAGE>\\nTo  ensure  the  adequacy and effectiveness of the Company\\'s  foreign\\nexchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the\\nrisks  and  opportunities  of the nonhedge  portfolios,  the  Company\\ncontinually  monitors  its  foreign  exchange  forward   and   option\\npositions, and its interest rate swap, swaption, and option positions\\non a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign\\ncurrency-  and  interest rate- related exposures, respectively,  from\\nboth  an accounting and an economic perspective.  However, given  the\\neffective horizons of the Company\\'s risk management activities, there\\ncan be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more\\nthan  a  portion  of  the  adverse financial  impact  resulting  from\\nunfavorable  movements in either foreign exchange or interest  rates.\\nAs  such, the Company\\'s operating results and financial position  may\\nbe adversely affected.\\nInventory\\nThe  Company\\'s  products  include certain components,  such  as  specific\\nmicroprocessors  manufactured  by  Motorola,  Inc.,  that  are  currently\\navailable  only  from  single  sources.   Any  availability  limitations,\\ninterruptions  in  supplies,  or  price  increases  of  these  and  other\\ncomponents  could adversely affect the Company\\'s business  and  financial\\nresults.   The Company\\'s future operating results and financial condition\\nmay  also  be  adversely  affected by the  Company\\'s  ability  to  manage\\ninventory levels and lead times required to obtain components in order to\\nbe  more responsive to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  In\\naddition,  if  anticipated unit sales growth for new and current  product\\nofferings  is not realized, inventory valuation reserves may be necessary\\nthat  would  adversely  affect the Company\\'s results  of  operations  and\\nfinancial condition.\\nMarketing and Distribution\\nA  number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and distribution\\nof  the  Company\\'s products.  Currently, the Company\\'s primary  means  of\\ndistribution  is  through third-party computer  resellers.   However,  in\\nresponse  to  changing industry practices and customer  preferences,  the\\nCompany is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels,  such\\nas  mass-merchandise  stores (for example, Sears and Wal-Mart),  consumer\\nelectronics  outlets, and computer superstores.  The  Company\\'s  business\\nand  financial  results  could be adversely  affected  if  the  financial\\ncondition of these sellers weakens or if sellers within consumer channels\\ndecide not to continue to distribute the Company\\'s products.\\nOther Factors\\nThe  majority  of the Company\\'s research and development activities,  its\\ncorporate  headquarters,  and  other  critical  business  operations  are\\nlocated  near major seismic faults. The Company\\'s operating  results  and\\nfinancial  condition could be materially adversely affected in the  event\\nof a major earthquake.\\nThe  Company  plans  to  replace its current transaction  systems  (which\\ninclude order management, distribution, manufacturing, and finance)  with\\na  single  integrated system as part of its ongoing  effort  to  increase\\noperational  efficiency.   The  Company\\'s future  operating  results  and\\nfinancial  condition  could  be adversely  affected  by  its  ability  to\\nimplement  and  effectively manage the transition to this new  integrated\\nsystem.\\nBecause of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the\\nCompany\\'s  operating  results  and financial  condition,  past  financial\\nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate\\nresults  or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the  Company\\'s\\nparticipation  in a highly dynamic industry often results in  significant\\nvolatility of the Company\\'s common stock price.\\n                                       18\\n<PAGE>\\n<TABLE>                                                           \\n<CAPTION>\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources                  1994     1993     1992\\n<S>                                              <C>      <C>      <C>\\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term                                     \\n  investments, net of short-term   borrowings    $   966  $    69  $ 1,251\\nWorking capital                                  $ 2,532  $ 1,830  $ 2,151\\nCash generated by (used for) operations          $   737  $ (651)  $   921\\nCash used for investment activities, excluding   \\n  short-term investments                         $   163  $   228  $   264                            \\nCash generated by (used for) financing            \\n  activities                                     $ (208)  $   336  $ (114) \\n</TABLE>                                                          \\nThe  Company\\'s financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents,\\nand  short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings,  increased  to\\n$966  million  at September 30, 1994, from $69 million at  September  24,\\n1993.   This  increase  reflects  a $300  million  issuance  of  ten-year\\nunsecured  notes,  the  proceeds  of which  replaced  a  portion  of  the\\nCompany\\'s   short-term  financing.   The  improvement  in  the  Company\\'s\\nfinancial  condition  was  also attributable to the  Company\\'s  continued\\nefforts  to  increase  profit  levels  and  to  manage  working  capital,\\nparticularly in the area of inventory management.\\nMore  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1994  compared  with  1993,\\nprimarily because of a significant  decrease in inventory levels, as well\\nas  increased sales levels.  The significant decrease in inventory levels\\nduring  1994  resulted  from improved inventory management,  higher  1994\\nsales levels attributable to various pricing and promotional actions, and\\nstrong  sales  of  new  product inventory which  had  been  built  up  in\\npreparation  for  the  introduction of Power  Macintosh.   Profit  levels\\nimproved   as   operating  expenses  decreased  due  to   the   Company\\'s\\nimplementation of restructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of\\n1993.\\nCash  generated by operations in 1994 was partially offset by  cash  used\\nfor  restructuring and an increase in accounts receivable.  The  increase\\nin  accounts  receivable reflected an increase in sales  levels  achieved\\nduring 1994.  The balance of accrued restructuring costs decreased as the\\nrestructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993 continued to\\nbe  implemented.  In addition, in the third quarter of 1994, the  Company\\nlowered  its estimate of the costs associated with the restructuring  and\\nrecorded  an  adjustment  that  increased income  by  $127  million  ($79\\nmillion,  or  $0.66  per share, after taxes).  This adjustment  primarily\\nreflected  the  modification or cancelation of certain  elements  of  the\\nCompany\\'s  original restructuring plan because of changing  business  and\\neconomic conditions that made certain elements of the restructuring  plan\\nfinancially less attractive than originally anticipated.\\nMore  cash  was used for operations in 1993 compared with 1992, primarily\\nbecause of a significant increase in inventory levels; decreases  in  net\\nincome,  income  taxes  payable, and other current  liabilities;  and  an\\nincrease  in  accounts receivable levels.  Cash used for  operations  was\\noffset  slightly by increases in accrued restructuring costs and accounts\\npayable.\\nInventory  increased  substantially during 1993 as  a  result  of  higher\\nlevels  of purchased parts, work in process, and finished goods inventory\\nin  support  of  an expanded product line and distribution  channels  and\\nanticipated  higher sales volumes.  The decrease in net  income  resulted\\nprimarily from a reduction in gross margins and the restructuring  charge\\nincluded  in operating expenses for the third quarter.  The reduction  in\\nearnings also contributed to the decrease in income taxes payable.  Other\\ncurrent  liabilities  decreased  as  the  Company  continued  to   manage\\noperating   expense   levels.   The  increase  in   accounts   receivable\\ncorresponded  to the higher sales levels achieved in 1993  compared  with\\n1992,  coupled with slower collections resulting from economic  pressures\\nin  the  reseller  industry, and the Company\\'s  expansion  into  consumer\\nchannels, where payment terms are generally longer.  These uses  of  cash\\nwere  offset slightly by increases in accrued restructuring  costs  as  a\\nresult of the Company\\'s plan to restructure its operations worldwide  and\\nincreases  in accounts payable, reflecting the higher level of  inventory\\npurchases.\\nExcluding short-term investments, net cash used for investments  declined\\nin  1994  compared  with 1993 and 1992 levels.  Net  cash  used  for  the\\npurchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $160 million in 1994,\\n                                       19\\n<PAGE>\\nand was primarily made up of increases in land, buildings, machinery, and\\nequipment.   The  Company anticipates that capital expenditures  in  1995\\nwill be slightly above 1994 expenditures.\\nThe  Company  leases the majority of its facilities and  certain  of  its\\nequipment  under noncancelable operating leases.  In 1994,  rent  expense\\nunder all operating leases was approximately $122 million.  The Company\\'s\\nfuture  lease  commitments are discussed on  page  38  of  the  Notes  to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\nThe  Company\\'s balance of long-term debt increased during 1994 due to the\\nissuance  of  $300 million aggregate principal amount of  6.5%  unsecured\\nnotes  under  an  omnibus  shelf registration statement  filed  with  the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.  This shelf registration was for  the\\nregistration  of  debt  and other securities for  an  aggregate  offering\\namount  of $500 million.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of par,  for  an\\neffective  yield  to  maturity of 6.51%.  The notes  pay  interest  semi-\\nannually and mature on February 15, 2004.  The 6.51% fixed-rate   was\\nsubsequently effectively converted to a floating-rate  through ten-year\\ninterest  rate swaps based on the six-month U.S. dollar London  Interbank\\nOffered Rate (LIBOR).  The impact of the swaps during 1994 was to  reduce\\nthe 6.51% fixed-rate yield to a 5.62% yield.  To mitigate the credit risk\\nassociated  with  these ten-year swap transactions, the  Company  entered\\ninto  margining  agreements  with  its third-party  bank  counterparties.\\nMargining  under  these agreements generally does not start  until  1997.\\nFurthermore,  these agreements would require the Company to  post  margin\\nonly  if certain credit risk thresholds were exceeded.  It is anticipated\\nthat  any margin the Company may be required to post in the future  would\\nnot have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s liquidity position.\\nShort-term  borrowings  at September 30, 1994,  were  approximately  $531\\nmillion  lower  than  at  September 24, 1993, as the  proceeds  from  the\\nissuance  of  $300 million in long-term debt were used to  pay  down  the\\nbalance  of  short-term borrowings.  The Company\\'s short-term  borrowings\\nreflect borrowings made under its commercial paper program and short-term\\nuncommitted  bid-line  arrangements with certain  commercial  banks.   In\\nparticular, Apple Japan, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the  Company,\\nincurred  short-term  yen-denominated borrowings  from  several  Japanese\\nbanks  during  1994,  the  balance of which aggregated  the  U.S.  dollar\\nequivalent  of approximately $202 million at September 30, 1994.   During\\nthe  first quarter of 1994, the Company also entered into a 364-day  $500\\nmillion  committed revolving credit facility which terminated on December\\n8, 1994, with a syndicate of banks primarily in support of its commercial\\npaper program.  No borrowings  were made under this facility.\\nThe  Company expects that it will continue to incur short- and  long-term\\nborrowings  from time to time to finance U.S. working capital  needs  and\\ncapital  expenditures,  because a substantial portion  of  the  Company\\'s\\ncash,  cash  equivalents, and short-term investments is held by  foreign\\nsubsidiaries,  generally  in U.S. dollar-denominated  holdings.

Our\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and\\nschedules based on our audits.\\nWe  conducted  our audits in accordance with generally accepted  auditing\\nstandards.

Policies\\n_________________________________________________________________________\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe  consolidated  financial statements include  the  accounts  of  Apple\\nComputer,   Inc.  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  (the   Company).\\nIntercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.    The\\nCompany\\'s fiscal year-end is the last Friday in September.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nThe  Company  recognizes  revenue  at  the  time  products  are  shipped.\\nProvisions  are  made currently for estimated product returns  and  price\\nprotection  that may occur under Company programs.  Historically,  actual\\namounts recorded for product returns and price protection have not varied\\nsignificantly from estimated amounts.\\nWarranty Expense\\nThe  Company  provides  currently for the  estimated  cost  that  may  be\\nincurred under product warranties when products are shipped.\\nForeign Currency \\nGains  and  losses  resulting  from  foreign  currency  translation   are\\naccumulated  as  a separate component of shareholders\\' equity  until  the\\nforeign  entity  is sold or liquidated. Gains and losses  resulting  from\\nforeign  currency  transactions are  included  in  the consolidated \\nstatements of income.\\nFinancial Instruments\\nAll highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less  at\\nthe  date  of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments\\nwith  maturities  between three and twelve months are  considered  to  be\\nshort-term  investments.  A substantial portion of  the  Company\\'s  cash,\\ncash   equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  is  held  by   foreign\\nsubsidiaries and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated  holdings.\\nAmounts  held  by foreign subsidiaries would be subject  to  U.S.  income\\ntaxation  upon repatriation to the United States; the Company\\'s financial\\nstatements  fully provide for any related tax liability on  amounts  that\\nmay  be  repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings that are intended\\nto be indefinitely invested.\\nThe  Company  has  not  elected early adoption  of  Financial  Accounting\\nStandard No. 115 (FAS 115), \"Accounting for Certain Investments  in  Debt\\nand  Equity  Securities\".  FAS 115 becomes effective beginning  with  the\\nCompany\\'s  first quarter of fiscal year 1995.   The principal  impact  of\\nthe  new  statement is to replace the historical cost accounting approach\\nfor  certain investments in debt and equity securities with one based  on\\nfair  value. The Company does not expect adoption of FAS 115  to  have  a\\nmaterial effect on its financial position or results of operations.\\nFor  further information regarding the Company\\'s accounting treatment  of\\nother  financial and derivative instruments, refer to pages 28-31  of\\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nIncome Taxes\\nEffective  September  25, 1993, the Company adopted Financial  Accounting\\nStandard No. 109 (FAS 109), \"Accounting for Income Taxes,\" which  changes\\nthe method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the\\nliability  method.  This change in accounting principle has been  adopted\\non a prospective basis, and the financial statements of years ended prior\\nto  September 25, 1993, have not been restated.  The cumulative effect of\\nthe  change  was  not material.  Under FAS 109, deferred tax  assets  and\\nliabilities   reflect  the  future  income  tax  effects   of   temporary\\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of  existing\\nassets  and  liabilities and their respective tax  bases.   Deferred  tax\\nassets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to\\ntaxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are\\n                                       27\\n<PAGE>\\nexpected  to  be  recovered or settled. Under  FAS  109,  the  effect  on\\ndeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is\\nrecognized  in  income in the period that includes  the  enactment  date.\\nPrior  to  1994,  the  Company  accounted  for  income  taxes  under  the\\nprovisions of APB Opinion No. 11, which recognized deferred taxes for the\\neffect of timing differences between pretax accounting income and taxable\\nincome.  Under the deferred method of APB Opinion No. 11, deferred  taxes\\nwere not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates.\\nU.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total  of  $335\\nmillion  of  undistributed earnings of certain of the  Company\\'s  foreign\\nsubsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will  be  indefinitely\\ninvested  in operations outside the United States.  It is not practicable\\nto  determine  the income tax liability that might be incurred  if  these\\nearnings  were to be distributed.  Except for such indefinitely  invested\\nearnings,  the Company provides federal and state income taxes  currently\\non undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\\nEarnings per Share\\nEarnings  per  share are computed using the weighted  average  number  of\\ncommon  and  dilutive  common  equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock\\noptions outstanding during the period.  Loss per share is computed  using\\nthe  weighted  average  number of common shares  outstanding  during  the\\nperiod.\\nInventories\\nInventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (first-in,  first-out)  or\\nmarket.   If  the  cost  of the inventories exceeds their  market  value,\\nprovisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the\\nmarket value.\\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\\nProperty,  plant,  and  equipment is stated at  cost.   Depreciation  and\\namortization  is computed by use of the declining balance  and  straight-\\nline methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior year amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets,\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Industry Segment and Geographic\\nInformation, and Income Taxes footnotes have been reclassified to conform\\nto the current year presentation.\\nFinancial Instruments\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nFinancial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk\\nIn the ordinary course of business and as part of the Company\\'s asset and\\nliability   management,  the  Company  enters  into  various   types   of\\ntransactions that involve contracts and financial instruments  with  off-\\nbalance-sheet  risk.   These instruments are entered  into  in  order  to\\nmanage  financial  market  risk,  including  interest  rate  and  foreign\\nexchange risk.  The Company enters into these financial instruments  with\\nmajor international financial institutions utilizing over-the-counter  as\\nopposed to exchange traded instruments.\\nInterest Rate Derivatives\\nThe  Company  enters  into interest rate derivatives, including  interest\\nrate  swaps, swaptions, and options, with financial institutions in  order\\nto  better match the Company\\'s floating-rate interest income on its  cash\\nequivalents  and  short-term investments with  the  fixed-rate  interest\\nexpense of its long-term debt.  These instruments are also used to extend\\nthe   effective  duration  of  a  portion  of  the  Company\\'s  short-term\\ninvestment  portfolio up to a maximum duration of  three  years,  and  to\\ndiversify  a  portion of its exposure away from changes in U.S.  interest\\nrates.\\n                                       28\\n<PAGE>\\nForeign Currency Instruments\\nThe  Company  enters into foreign exchange forward and  option  contracts\\nwith   financial  institutions  primarily  to  protect  against  currency\\nexchange risks associated with certain firmly committed and certain other\\nprobable,  but not firmly committed transactions.  The Company\\'s  foreign\\nexchange risk management policy requires it to hedge substantially all of\\nits  material  foreign  exchange  transaction  exposures.   However,  the\\nCompany  does  not  hedge certain foreign exchange transaction  exposures\\nthat are immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S dollar value  or\\nin terms of their high correlation with the U.S. dollar.\\nAnticipated  transactions  comprise sales of the  Company\\'s  products  in\\ncurrencies  other  than the U.S. dollar.  A majority  of  these  non-U.S.\\ndollar-based sales are made through the Company\\'s subsidiaries in Europe,\\nAsia  (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia. The duration of  these\\nanticipated  hedging transactions does not exceed one year.  The  Company\\nalso  sells  foreign  exchange option contracts, in  order  to  partially\\nfinance  the purchase of foreign exchange option contracts used to  hedge\\nboth  firmly  committed  and  certain  other  probable,  but  not  firmly\\ncommitted  transactions.  The Company enters into other foreign  exchange\\ntransactions, which are intended to reduce the costs associated with  its\\nforeign exchange risk management programs.\\nFair Value, Notional  Principal, and Credit Risk Amounts\\nThe table below shows the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk\\namounts  of  the Company\\'s interest rate derivative and foreign  currency\\ninstruments as of September 30, 1994.  The notional principal amounts for\\noff-balance-sheet  instruments provide one  measure  of  the  transaction\\nvolume outstanding as of year end, and do not represent the amount of the\\nCompany\\'s  exposure  to credit or market loss.  The  credit  risk  amount\\nshown  in  the  table below represents the Company\\'s  gross  exposure  to\\npotential  accounting  loss on these transactions if  all  counterparties\\nfailed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on  then-\\ncurrent  currency  exchange and interest rates at each  respective  date.\\nThe Company\\'s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time\\nas a function of interest rates and currency exchange rates.\\nThe  estimates  of fair value are based on applicable and  commonly  used\\npricing  models  using  prevailing financial  market  information  as  of\\nSeptember  30, 1994.  In certain instances where judgment is required  in\\nestimating  fair value, price quotes were obtained from  several  of  the\\nCompany\\'s counterparty financial institutions.  Although the table  below\\nreflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk  amounts  of\\nthe  Company\\'s  interest  rate and foreign  exchange instruments, it does \\nnot reflect the gains or losses associated with  the exposures  and  \\ntransactions that the interest rate and foreign  exchange instruments are \\nintended to hedge.  The amounts ultimately realized  upon settlement  of \\nthese financial instruments, together with the  gains  and losses  on  the  \\nunderlying  exposures,  will  depend  on  actual  market conditions during \\nthe remaining life of the instruments.\\n                                       29\\n<PAGE>\\n<TABLE>                                                     (in millions)\\n<CAPTION>\\n                               1994                    1993(A)\\n                                                                      \\n                                               Credit                  Credit\\n                            Notional   Fair    Risk    Notional  Fair  Risk\\n                            Principal  Value   Amount  Principal Value Amount\\n                                                 \\nTransactions Qualifying as Accounting Hedges\\n<S>                           <C>      <C>      <C>     <C>      <C>    <C>\\nInterest rate instruments                                                 \\n  Swaps                     $  699    $ (40)      --         --    --      --                                \\nForeign exchange instruments                                             \\n  Spot / Forward contracts  $2,385    $ (23)    $ 15    $ 2,114  $  6   $  19\\n  Purchased options         $1,510    $   17    $ 21    $ 1,637  $ 28   $  33  \\n  Sold options              $  302    $  (1)      --    $   765  --(B)     --\\n                                                                                          \\nTransactions Other Than Accounting Hedges\\n                                                                          \\nInterest rate instruments                                                 \\n  Swaps                        --        --      --     $   112  --(B)     --\\n  Sold options              $  148     --(B)     --     $    67  --(B)     --\\nForeign exchange instruments                                             \\n  Spot / Forward contracts  $  300     --(B)   --(B)    $   574  $  2   $  10\\n  Purchased options         $1,600    $   32   $ 32     $ 1,608  $ 24   $  24\\n  Sold options              $5,511    $ (45)     --     $ 5,282  $(39)     --\\n</TABLE>                                                                  \\n(A) Adjusted to conform with current year presentation.\\n(B) Fair value is less than $0.5 million.\\nThe  interest rate swaps shown above generally require the Company to pay\\na  floating interest rate based on three- or six-month U.S. dollar  LIBOR\\nand  receive a fixed rate of interest based on two-, three-, and ten-year\\nswap   rates  without  exchanges  of  the  underlying  notional  amounts.\\nMaturity  dates for interest rate swaps currently range from one  to  ten\\nyears.

As such, the Company  generally  does  not\\nrequire collateral from its customers.\\nThe   counterparties  to  the  agreements  relating  to   the   Company\\'s\\ninvestments and foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of\\na number of major international financial institutions.  To date, no such\\ncounterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.\\nThe  Company  does  not  believe  that  there  is  significant  risk   of\\nnonperformance  by  these counterparties because the Company  continually\\nmonitors its positions and the credit ratings of such counterparties, and\\nlimits  the financial exposure and the amount of agreements and contracts\\nit  enters  into  with  any one party.  The Company  generally  does  not\\nrequire  collateral  from counterparties, except  for  margin  agreements\\nassociated  with the ten-year interest rate swaps on the Company\\'s  long-\\nterm  debt.   To mitigate the credit risk associated with these  ten-year\\nswap transactions, the Company entered into margining agreements with its\\nthird-party  bank  counterparties.   Margining  under  these   agreements\\ngenerally does not start until 1997.  Furthermore, these agreements would\\nrequire  the Company or the counterparty to post margin only  if  certain\\ncredit risk thresholds were exceeded.\\n                                       31\\n<PAGE>\\n                                        \\n<TABLE>                                                      \\n<CAPTION>\\nInventories                                                           \\nInventories consist of the following:                    (In thousands)\\n                                                                \\n                                                     1994         1993\\n<S>                                            <C>          <C>     \\nPurchased parts                                $  469,420   $  504,201                                                       \\nWork in process                                   206,654      284,440\\nFinished goods                                    412,360      717,997\\n                                               $1,088,434   $1,506,638\\n                                                                   \\n</TABLE>                                                              \\nBorrowings\\n_________________________________________________________________________\\n<TABLE>                                                              \\n<CAPTION>                                                  (In thousands)\\nShort-Term Borrowings                                         \\n                                                         1994        1993\\n<S>                                                <C>        <C>          \\nCommercial paper                                   $   89,817  $  823,182\\nNotes payable to banks                                202,383          --\\n                                                   $  292,200  $  823,182\\n</TABLE>                                                      \\nThe  weighted  average interest rates for commercial paper borrowings  at\\nSeptember 30, 1994, and September 24, 1993, were approximately  5.0%  and\\n3.3%, respectively.

In connection with this plan, the Company  recorded\\na  $321  million charge to operating expenses ($199 million, or  $1.72  per\\nshare,  after  taxes).  The restructuring costs included  $162  million  of\\nestimated   employee-related  expenses  and  $159  million   of   estimated\\nfacilities, equipment, and other expenses associated with the consolidation\\nof  operations and the relocation and termination of certain operations and\\nemployees.   The restructuring plan originally contemplated the termination\\nor relocation of approximately 4,150 employees worldwide and the reduction\\nin  worldwide office space, which primarily consisted of approximately  1.6\\nmillion  square feet of office space in the San Francisco Bay  Area, within\\none year from the date the restructuring was initiated.\\nIn the third quarter of 1994, the Company lowered its estimate of the total\\ncosts  associated  with the restructuring and recorded an  adjustment  that\\nincreased  income by $127 million ($79 million, or $0.66 per  share,  after\\ntaxes).    This   adjustment  primarily  reflected  the   modification   or\\ncancelation  of  certain  elements of the Company\\'s original  restructuring\\nplan because of changing business and economic conditions that made certain\\nelements  of  the  restructuring plan  financially  less attractive  than  \\noriginally anticipated.  In addition, some  actions  were completed at a \\nlower cost than originally estimated.\\nThe  most  significant element of the adjustment was  associated  with  $61\\nmillion  in  costs accrued to terminate or move a number of employees  from\\nthe  San Francisco Bay Area to a lower-cost location.  This element of  the\\nCompany\\'s   restructuring plan  was  expected  to  result  in  the\\ntermination or relocation of approximately 2,000 employees and the  closure\\nof  certain  leased facilities, at a cost of $39 million and  $22  million,\\nrespectively.   However, the expected benefits of this  move  were  reduced\\nsince  the  plan\\'s  inception because of changes to the  cost  differential\\nbetween the Company\\'s current and alternative locations.  For example,  the\\nCompany favorably renegotiated the lease terms of certain facilities in its\\ncurrent  locations, the salary growth rate differentials  between  the  Bay\\nArea  and  alternative locations were reduced, and recent  changes  to  the\\nCalifornia  income  tax laws made it more attractive for  companies  to  do\\nbusiness  in  California.  The Company canceled this action  in  the  third\\nquarter  of 1994, when management decided that the extended estimated  pay-\\nback  period  no  longer  justified the initial  cash  investment  and  the\\nunquantifiable  cost  of  business  disruption  that  such  a  move   would\\nprecipitate.\\nAt  the  end  of fiscal year 1994, approximately 1,760 employees  had  been\\nterminated  and  approximately 80 had been relocated, and the  Company  had\\nreduced  its  use of office space in the Bay Area by approximately  867,000\\nsquare feet.\\nAt the time the restructuring was announced, management had publicly set  a\\ngoal  of  reducing  operating  costs below $500  million  per  quarter  and\\nincreasing sales significantly to achieve acceptable profitability.   These\\ngoals were met by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1994.  The Company\\ncontinues  to  search  for ways to permanently reduce its  cost  structure.  \\nAlthough  the  Company  has achieved a lower level  of  operating  expenses\\nwithout  fully implementing all of the restructuring actions as  originally\\nplanned, there can be no assurance that this level of operating expenses will\\nbe maintained in the future.  For example, operating expenses (excluding \\nrestructure)  in  1994 were  reduced  by  $349  million, or 15%, compared \\nwith  1993,  despite  an increase in net sales of 15%.\\nAs  of  September  30,  1994,  the  Company  had  $58  million  of  accrued\\nrestructuring costs for actions that are currently under way  and  expected\\nto  be  completed during 1995.  Approximately $52 million of  this  accrual\\nrepresents cash charges primarily for estimated facilities, equipment,  and\\nother  expenses,  the majority of which are expected to be incurred  during\\n1995.  Cash spending beyond one year primarily relates to approximately  $6\\nmillion of recurring payments under certain noncancelable operating leases.\\n                                       33\\n<PAGE>\\nThe  following table depicts a roll-forward reconciliation of the  activity\\nin  the restructuring accrual balance from September 24, 1993, to September\\n30, 1994:\\n                                                                  \\n                                                             (in thousands)\\n                                                        \\n                                   Balance at                    Balance at\\n                                   Sept. 24,            Adjust-  Sept. 30,\\nCategory                           1993       Spending   ments   1994\\n                                                                       \\nEmployee termination payments(C)   $  84,062 $  42,376 $  30,933  $ 10,753\\nOther costs relating to terminated     \\n employees (B)                         4,282     3,227     1,055        --\\nProvisions relating to employees      \\n who will not be terminated (C)       41,818     8,536    28,603     4,679\\nTermination payments for leases and   \\n other contracts (C)                  92,736    32,907    39,728    20,101\\nWrite-down of operating assets to    \\n be sold (N)                          16,864     9,748     5,925     1,191\\nProvisions for litigation (C)          3,600        --     1,856     1,744\\nR&D project cancelations (C)          14,858     7,043     1,624     6,191\\nOther provisions and write-downs (B)  31,863    10,254     8,875    12,734\\n1991 accrued restructuring costs (B)  17,849     8,748     8,256       845\\n                                        \\n                                   $ 307,932 $ 122,839 $ 126,855  $ 58,238\\n                                                                       \\n(C): Cash;

The Rights are\\nredeemable and  may be amended at the Company\\'s option before they become \\nexercisable.

These options generally become  exercisable  over\\nvarying periods, based on continued employment, and generally expire  ten\\nyears  after  the  grant  date.  The 1990 Plan permits  the  granting  of\\nincentive   stock   options,  nonstatutory  stock  options,   and   stock\\nappreciation rights.\\nThe  1987  Plan permits the granting of nonstatutory options  to  certain\\nofficers of the Company to purchase Apple common stock at prices not less\\nthan 75% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options under the\\n1987  Plan are generally not exercisable for 18 months after the date  of\\ngrant,  and  then become exercisable at varying rates over the subsequent\\nseven years, based on continued service to the Company.\\nSummarized information regarding the Company\\'s stock option plans as of\\nSeptember 30, 1994, is as follows:\\n<TABLE>                            (In thousands, except per share amounts)\\n<CAPTION>                                                      \\n                                         Number of         Price Per\\n                                          Shares            Share\\n<S>                                     <C>                 <C>    \\nOutstanding at September 24, 1993       13,096              $ 7.50- $ 68.00\\n  Granted                                4,705                    \\n  Exercised                            (2,223)              $ 23.50-$ 38.25\\n  Expired or canceled                  (2,167)\\nOutstanding at September 30, 1994       13,411              $ 7.50- $ 68.00\\nExercisable                              5,475                           \\nReserved for issuance                   19,286                           \\nAvailable for future grant               5,879                           \\n</TABLE>                                                                   \\nRestricted Stock Plan\\nOn  April 1, 1993, the Company\\'s Board of Directors approved a Restricted\\nStock  Plan for officers of the Company (the RSP), which became effective\\nJuly  1, 1993.  The RSP was subsequently ratified by the shareholders  on\\nJanuary  26, 1994.   The  RSP is designed to  provide  an  incentive  for\\nofficers to continue to own shares of the Company\\'s common stock acquired\\nupon  exercise of options under any of the Company\\'s Stock Option  Plans,\\nthus  more closely aligning officers\\' financial interests with  those  of\\nthe  shareholders.   The RSP provides that officers  who  exercise  stock\\noptions  and  continue to hold the exercised shares for  at  least  three\\nyears  will  receive  up to three Awards of shares of  restricted  stock.\\nEach  such  Award  is  for one-third the number of shares  held  for  the\\nrequisite retention period.  Each restricted stock Award granted pursuant\\nto  the  plan  becomes  fully vested three years after  the  grant  date,\\nprovided  that  the  officer  maintains continuous  employment  with  the\\nCompany and that other vesting requirements are met.\\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\\nThe Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan) under\\nwhich  substantially  all  employees may purchase  common  stock  through\\npayroll  deductions  at a price equal to 85% of the  lower  of  the  fair\\nmarket  values as of the beginning or end of the offering period.   Stock\\npurchases  under  the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of  an  employee\\'s\\ncompensation,  up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar  year.   As  of\\nSeptember  30,  1994, approximately 1 million shares  were  reserved  for\\nfuture issuance under the Purchase Plan.\\nStock Repurchase Programs\\nIn November 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to\\n10  million shares of the Company\\'s common stock in the open market.   No\\nshares   were  repurchased  under  this  authorization  in  1994,   while\\napproximately   3.4   million   shares  were   repurchased   under   this\\nauthorization  in  1993.   In  September 1990,  the  Board  of  Directors\\nauthorized  the  purchase  of up to 10 million shares  of  the  Company\\'s\\ncommon  stock  in  the open market.  During 1993 and  1992,  the  Company\\nrepurchased   the   remaining  shares  under  this  authorization,  which\\napproximated to 1.6 million and 4.0 million shares, respectively.\\n                                        \\n                                       37\\n<PAGE>\\nSavings Plan\\nThe  Company  has  an  employee  savings plan  (the  Savings  Plan)  that\\nqualifies  as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k)  of  the\\nInternal  Revenue  Code.   Under  the Savings  Plan,  participating  U.S.\\nemployees  may  defer  a  portion of their pretax  earnings,  up  to  the\\nInternal  Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($9,240 for  calendar\\nyear  1994).  Effective July 1, 1994, the Company matches 30% to  70%  of\\neach  employee\\'s contributions, depending on length of service, up  to  a\\nmaximum  6%  of  the  employee\\'s earnings.  Prior to July  1,  1994,  the\\nCompany matched 30% to 50% of each employee\\'s contributions, depending on\\nlength  of  service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee\\'s earnings.   The\\nCompany\\'s  matching contributions to the Savings Plan were  approximately\\n$10.7 million in 1994 and $11.1 million in each of 1993 and 1992.\\nPreferred Stock\\n_________________________________________________________________________\\nFive  million shares of preferred stock have been authorized for issuance\\nin  one or more series.

The major facilities leases are for terms of\\nfive to ten years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up  to\\nfive  additional  years.   Rent  expense under  all  operating  leases  was\\napproximately $122 million, $170 million, and $160 million in  1994,  1993,\\nand   1992,  respectively.

Programs are typically directed\\nthrough the mail, utilizing lists of targeted individuals.  The Company uses\\ndirect marketing to promote sales of new versions of products to existing\\nusers.

Information with respect to international operations and export\\nsales may be found on page 17 of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, which\\nis incorporated herein by reference.\\nOEM CHANNEL\\nThe Company\\'s operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements\\nthat grant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of Microsoft\\'s products with\\nthe OEMs\\' microcomputers. The Company also markets certain language and\\napplications programs to OEMs under similar arrangements.  In addition, the\\nCompany markets the Microsoft Mouse and BallPoint Mouse to OEMs for\\ndistribution to buyers of the OEMs\\' computers.  In almost all cases, the\\nproducts are distributed under Microsoft trademarks.  The Company has OEM\\nagreements covering one or more of its products with virtually all of the major\\nmicrocomputer OEMs, including AST Research, DEC, Dell, Compaq, Fujitsu, Gateway\\n2000, IBM, NEC, Olivetti, Packard Bell, Toshiba, Unisys, and Zenith.\\nADVERTISING\\nThe Company works closely with large advertising and direct marketing firms.\\nAdvertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging, and marketing materials are\\ntargeted to various end-user segments.  The Company utilizes broad consumer\\nmedium (television, radio, and business publications) and trade publications.\\nMicrosoft also invests heavily in direct marketing and customer satisfaction\\nareas.  In 1995, the Company plans to spend more than $100 million on a broad\\ncampaign emphasizing Microsoft brand identity.\\nPRODUCT SUPPORT\\nThe Company\\'s Product Support Services group, with locations in the\\nU.S. and in Microsoft subsidiaries, provides product support coverage options\\nto meet the needs of users of Microsoft products.  The Company hires\\nindividuals with proven product expertise and provides them with productivity\\ntools, continuous product education and training, and consistent processes to\\ndeliver quality support for Microsoft products.  Coverage options range from\\nstandard no-charge toll telephone support to fee-based offerings providing\\nunlimited 800# telephone and electronic technical support across all Microsoft\\nproducts 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\\nUsers have access to Microsoft KnowledgeBase, a repository of over\\n55,000 technical articles that is updated regularly with useful information\\nregarding Microsoft products.  Microsoft provides access to KnowledgeBase via\\nCompuServe(R), GEnie(TM), Prodigy, America Online, and Internet.  Additionally,\\nthe Company offers two information subscription services: Microsoft TechNet and\\nMicrosoft Developer Network.\\nAs a supplement or alternative to direct support, the Company enhances the\\nthird party support channel by providing Microsoft Solutions Providers with\\neducation, training, tools, and support.  Microsoft Solutions Providers\\ninclude Authorized Training Centers, which offer advanced product education and\\ncertification on Microsoft products; and Authorized Support Centers, which\\nprovide a wide spectrum of multinational support, multivendor support, and\\nintegration services.\\n                                       7\\n<PAGE>   10\\nCUSTOMERS\\nAs described above, Microsoft has three customer types: end users,\\norganizations, and OEMs.  The Company believes that most of the end users of\\nits products are individuals in businesses, government agencies, educational\\ninstitutions, and at home.  These end users obtain Microsoft products primarily\\nthrough distributors, resellers, and OEMs, which include certain Microsoft\\nproducts with their hardware.  Notes to Financial Statements on page 13 of the\\n1994 Annual Report to Shareholders describe customers that represent more than\\n10% of the Company\\'s revenues.  The Company\\'s practice is to ship its products\\npromptly upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers and, consequently,\\nbacklog is not significant.\\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\\nThe microcomputer software industry is characterized by rapid technological\\nchange, which requires a continuous high level of expenditures for enhancing\\nexisting products and developing new products.  The Company is committed to\\ncontinued expenditures for research and product development.\\nMost of the Company\\'s software products are developed internally.  The Company\\nalso purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees\\nthird party development for certain products.  Product documentation is also\\ncreated internally.  Internal development enables Microsoft to maintain closer\\ntechnical control over the products and gives the Company the freedom to\\ndesignate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they\\nshould be implemented.  The Company has created a substantial body of\\nproprietary development tools and has evolved a development methodology for\\ncreating and enhancing its products.  These tools and methodology are also\\ndesigned to simplify a product\\'s portability among different operating systems\\nor computers.\\nThe Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is\\ngetting it to market quickly to respond to a new user need or an advance in\\nhardware design, without compromising product quality.  The Company strives to\\nbecome as informed as possible at the earliest possible time about\\ntechnological advances and changing usage patterns.\\nDuring fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994, the Company spent $352 million, $470\\nmillion, and $610 million, respectively, on product research and development\\nactivities.  Those amounts represented 12.8%, 12.5%, and 13.1%, respectively,\\nof net revenues in each of those years.\\nCOMPETITION\\nThe microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and subject to rapid\\nchange.  The Company\\'s competitors include many independent software vendors,\\nsuch as Lotus Development, Oracle, and Novell.  These companies generally have\\na narrower focus than the Company in product offerings such as spreadsheets,\\nrelational databases, word processors, and networking software.\\nLarge personal computer OEMs are devoting significant resources to creating\\noperating systems, notably IBM, Apple Computer, and Sun Microsystems.\\nMicrosoft markets its operating systems products to OEMs and end users.  The\\nCompany competes for that business with the large OEMs and joint ventures of\\nOEMs, and independent systems software vendors, such as Novell.\\nThe Company believes that the principal competitive factors in marketing\\nmicrocomputer software are the product\\'s reputation, features and functions,\\nease of use, reliability, price relative to performance, timeliness of\\ndelivery, and availability and quality of support services.  There is no\\nassurance that the Company\\'s competitive position will not be adversely\\naffected by one or more of these factors in the future.\\nSee \"Outlook: Issues and Risks\" on page 6 of the 1994 Annual Report to\\nShareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.\\n                                       8\\n<PAGE>   11\\nPRODUCT PROTECTION\\nMicrosoft regards the intellectual property used in its software as proprietary\\nand attempts to protect it with copyrights, patents, trade secret laws,\\ninternal and external nondisclosure safeguards, and restrictions on disclosure\\nand transfer that are incorporated into its software license agreements.\\nDespite these restrictions, it is possible for competitors and users to copy\\naspects of the Company\\'s products or to obtain and use information that the\\nCompany regards as proprietary. Existing laws protecting intellectual property\\nare helpful but imperfect aids in preventing unauthorized copying and use of\\nthe Company\\'s products.  Monitoring and identifying unauthorized copying and\\nuse of software can be difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem\\nfor the software industry.  Piracy is  particularly acute in international\\nmarkets.  Some of the Company\\'s products distributed internationally use\\nelectronic copy protection to assist in preventing unauthorized copies, but the\\nmore typical Company antipiracy strategy is to work with others in the industry\\nto secure the passage of appropriate laws protecting software, to educate the\\nmarket and persuade users about the benefits of legitimate software, and to\\nparticipate in selective enforcement actions.\\nMANUFACTURING\\nThe Company has manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Puerto\\nRico, and Ireland.  The Company\\'s manufacturing operations involve the\\nduplication of disks, assembly of purchased parts, and final packaging.\\nQuality control tests are performed on purchased parts, duplicated disks, and\\nfinished products.  The chief materials and components used in Microsoft\\nproducts include disks, books, and multicolor printed materials.  The Company\\nis often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount\\nbasis.  The Company has multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and\\ncomponents.\\nThe Company contracts a portion of its manufacturing activity to third parties.\\nOutside manufacturers produce software products, documentation, and hardware\\nsuch as mouse pointing devices.  There are other custom manufacturers in the\\nevent that products become unavailable from current sources.\\nEMPLOYEES\\nAs of June 30, 1994, the Company employed 15,257 people, 10,264 domestically\\nand 4,993 internationally.  Of the total, 4,417 were in product research and\\ndevelopment, 8,079 in sales, marketing, and support, 1,344 in manufacturing and\\ndistribution, and 1,417 in finance and administration.  Microsoft\\'s success is\\nhighly dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\\nCompetition for employees is intense in the software industry.  To date, the\\nCompany believes it has been successful in its efforts to recruit qualified\\nemployees, but there is no assurance that it will continue to be as successful\\nin the future.  None of the Company\\'s employees are subject to collective\\nbargaining agreements.  The Company believes that relations with its employees\\nare excellent.\\n                                       9\\n<PAGE>   12\\nItem 2.
